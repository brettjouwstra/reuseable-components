## Reuseable Components
Modals, Upload Scripts, etc. that can be re-used project to project

#### Pure Javascript Modal

Create a button to show the modal and another to close/hide it. All created with pure JS. 

> Based on a [DevEd](https://developedbyed.com/) tutorial 


#### Jinja2 Template

The generic template I use to extend the "base.html" file. Includes two scripts sections one that calls super() and one that does not. This shouldn't be necessary but it's available anyways.
